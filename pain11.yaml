            Scope
            
            The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message is sent by the initiating party to the forwarding agent or debtor agent. It is used to request movement of funds from the debtor account to a creditor.
            
            Usage
            
            The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message can contain one or more customer credit transfer instructions.
            
            The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message is used to exchange:
            
            - One or more instances of a credit transfer initiation;
            
            - Payment transactions that result in book transfers at the debtor agent or payments to another financial institution;
            
            - Payment transactions that result in an electronic cash transfer to the creditor account or in the emission of a cheque.
            
            The message can be used in a direct or a relay scenario:
            
            - In a direct scenario, the message is sent directly to the debtor agent. The debtor agent is the account servicer of the debtor.
            
            - In a relay scenario, the message is sent to a forwarding agent. The forwarding agent acts as a concentrating financial institution. It will forward the CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message to the debtor agent.
            
            The message can also be used by an initiating party that has authority to send the message on behalf of the debtor. This caters for example for the scenario of a payments factory initiating all payments on behalf of a large corporate.
            
            The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message can be used in domestic and cross-border scenarios.
            
            The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message must not be used by the debtor agent to execute the credit transfer instruction(s). The FIToFICustomerCreditTransfer message must be used instead.
